# Names scores
# Problem 22
# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing
# over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out
# the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
# list to obtain a name score.
#
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
# 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of
# 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
#
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
#
# A hilarious problem, with a fairly simple implementation in Python.
#
# Sorting is trivial (although implementing my own sorting algorithm may
# have been a fun exercise), and there exist libraries to read CSV files.
