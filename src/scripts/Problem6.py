# Sum square difference
# Problem 6
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
# 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
#
# This problem is relatively straightforward. Easy optimization can be
# performed by using the closed-form solution for summations, making the
# code extensible to much, much larger values of MAX_NUM without performance
# issues.
