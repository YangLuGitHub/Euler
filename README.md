# Euler
My Project Euler solutions in various languages. 

Currently, solutions are written in **Python 3** for convenience, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as the IDE.

Tested with Python 3.5.2 interpreter. May work on earlier versions of Python 3. Most likely does not work in Python 2.  

Future solutions are not guaranteed to be in Python. 

Runtime of all algorithms are <1ms on my test machine, except those listed below (potential targets for future optimization):

* Problem4.py (~3ms)
* Problem7.py (~5ms)
* Problem10.py (~0.23s)
