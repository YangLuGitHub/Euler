# Euler
My Project Euler solutions in various languages. 

Currently, solutions are written in **Python 3** for convenience, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as the IDE.

Tested with Python 3.5.2 interpreter. May work on earlier versions of Python 3. Most likely does not work in Python 2.

Future solutions are not guaranteed to be in Python. 

Solutions are not typically optimized beyond what is necessary to get a reasonable run time, although that is not to say there aren't obvious optimizations left. They are structured to be easy to understand, extensible to the general case (when possible), and simple to maintain - which is not necessarily mutually exclusive with "optimized".
 
_"Code golf"_ solutions are generally not too useful beyond the initial challenge, and are frequently hard to understand for other people. Therefore, they will typically not be included here. 

Runtime of all algorithms are `<1ms` on my test machine, except those listed below (potential targets for future optimization):

* `Problem4.py (~3ms)`
* `Problem7.py (~5ms)`
* `Problem10.py (~0.23s)`
* `Problem11.py (~2ms)`
* `Problem12.py (~0.13s)`
* `Problem13.py (~2ms)`
* `Problem14.py (~3.3s)`
* `Problem16.py (~7ms)`
* `Problem17.py (~2ms)`
* `Problem21.py (~86ms)`
* `Problem22.py (~8ms)`
* `Problem23.py (~1.8s)`
* `Problem25.py (~3ms)`
* `Problem26.py (~0.27s)`
* `Problem67.py (~5ms)`
